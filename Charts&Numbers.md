Individual Plants

Kootha’s Actual EBIT numbers were much better than they were forecasted for Sept, Oct 2013 where it followed the budget numbers for the rest of time except June 2014, where less revenue and high overhead costs dipped the numbers by 26%

Surjek’s Actual EBIT numbers fluctuated throughout the given period but stayed above the budget numbers except for Nov 2013 and May 2014 (due to high overhead costs).

Jutik’s Actual EBIT numbers stayed below the budget number throughout the given time. Despite showing some promises in April & May 2014, the numbers plummeted in June 2014. Generating less revenue and constant Overhead costs are the primary reasons behind Jutik’s low performance.
