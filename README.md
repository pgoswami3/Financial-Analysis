## Problem Statement

What opportunity exists for Southern Water Corporation to increase revenue by studying Cost to Produce water and resolve sizable discrepancies in the budget for the calendar year?

## Context
Southern Water Corp is facing an increase in demand of desalinated water for public, private and residential consumption. Due to the continual demand, the revenues has surged and management is looking into areas of improvement. 

The management has asked to provide accountability and a detailed breakdown for Cost to Produce (CTP) water. Financial Business Unit (FBU) has been asked to look into Year-to-Date Variance Analysis to find sizable discrepancies in budget figures and present high level aggregation of the financial data.

## Criteria for success
- Encounter sizable discrepancies between the actual and budget figures.
- Finding accountability in Cost to Produce water (CTP) drivers.
- Detect unusual figures in the business’ financial health reports

## Scope of solution space
- Revenue, Production Costs, Earning before interest and tax (EBIT), Depreciation and Amortization.
- Year-to-Date Variance Analysis for actual and budget figures
- Cost to produce (CTP) drivers

Definitions | SW Corp
--- | ---
Revenues |	Revenues generated through Sales of Water to Residential, Public and Private Corporations and Individuals
Production Cost |	Costs associated with producing desalinated water
Other Production Costs | Costs associated with 'Other' Production Costs as opposed to pure desalination watering costs
Assets	| Assets owned by Southern Water Corp Financials. Assets = Owners Equity + Liabilities
EBIT |	Earnings Before Interest and Tax. Calculated as Revenues - COGS (Production Costs) - Overheads 
Cost to Produce Per Litre	| (Production Cost + Other Production Costs + Overheads) / Total Water Production


## Economies

- As we have numbers for 2013-14 Actual Costs V/s. Budgeted Costs, we can do find the variance where we can find major dent in our expenses
